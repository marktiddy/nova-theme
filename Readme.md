## Notes about assets

As the Invision App didn't provide any assets to download icons have been replaced with Material Icons and some simple placeholder images have been used.

## Design Notes

There were a few places where it didn't feel like the font sizes laid out in the design file matched the designed components pictured. In a real life scenario I'd have made a note to take this back to the design team to check however in this case I adjusted a couple of font sizes to better match.

## Layout Notes

For simplicity in accessing this task everything has been put into one file found in src/views/index.html and the whole repository can be cloned and then have the command `npm run start` to view the project.

The different sections of the page have been separated with a comment in the index.html and in a real-world scenario these would be broken into template parts/components which can easily be reused. It's for this reason the scss is separated into components so that these become separated, reusable components that could even be used across projects.

## Code Notes

As the task stated that you wanted to see as much of my own SCSS/JS as possible I didn't use a library like Tailwind or Bootstrap and went for a no-library approach which demonstrates my capabilities however, in a real life scenario a library would significantly improve build time for a site!
